# How to Think Like a Computer Scientis

## Chapter 1

### The way of the program 

  The gold of this book, and this class, is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. I like the way computer scientists think because they combine some of the best features of Mathematics, Engineering, and Natural Science. Like Mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas(specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating trade offs among alternative.
